				On December 12, 1990, web inventor Tim Berners-Lee published the first web site ever on the Internet after he
				figured out the basic concept of the web including Uniform Resource Locator (URL), Hypertext Transfer Protocol
				(HTTP), and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition, he created the browser and wrote the software to run the
				web server. The project Berners-Lee launched was about the World Wide Web, in which he defined, “a wide-area
				hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.”
				(Berners-Lee 1990) The site has nothing but texts and links to other documents.
